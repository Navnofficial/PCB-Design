## üöÄ Getting Started (Manufacturing Guide)

To create your own ESP32-S3 HAT V2, follow these steps:

1.  **Download the Gerbers**: Clone this repository or download the contents of the `/GERBER/` directory as a single ZIP file.
2.  **Order the PCB**: Upload the ZIP file to a PCB manufacturer of your choice (e.g., JLCPCB, PCBWay, OSH Park) and place your order.
3.  **Source Components**: Use the Bill of Materials file located in the `/BOM/` directory to order all necessary electronic components from a distributor like Digi-Key, Mouser, or LCSC.
4.  **Assemble the Board**: Solder the components onto the PCB. You can use the schematic, PCB layout files, and the board preview image as a reference for component placement.
